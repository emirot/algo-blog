## New Blog

I realized, most of the time, I'm not able to find back my answers from previous coding challenges.  
I can remember a similiar problem or want to have a quick reminder about something and I can't find it...  
With this blog, I'm hoping that it will change, I'll try to keep things nice and tidy.  
I used to post them on [www.blog.nolanemirot.com](www.nolanemirot.com) but I feel it's more convenient to have another blog for that.
